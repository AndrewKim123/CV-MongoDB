    <h1>Product Marketing Intern</h1> 
    <h3>Why am I so interested in this role with MongoDB?</h3>
    <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>
    <p>I am writing to express my interest in the Product Marketing Intern position at MongoDB. As a Marketing major at RBS with a 3.7 GPA and a passion for computer programming, I believe I am the perfect candidate for this role..</p>
    <p>In high school, I began coding as a hobby, starting with Visual Basic and moved up to JavaScript and C++. Since then, I have worked my way up to learning more advanced programming languages, including React. I also recently completed a six-month coding bootcamp in February 2021, where I learned about MongoDB and saw it as a future technology I would like to work with.</p>
    <p>I am excited about the opportunity to apply my marketing and coding skills at MongoDB and contribute to the success of the company. I am confident that my education and experience make me an ideal fit for this role and I am eager to learn and grow as a product marketing intern at MongoDB.</p>
    <p>
        Thank you for considering my application. I look forward for a reply!
    </p>
    <p>Sincerely,</p>
    <p>Andrew Kim</p>
